/*
 * Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

 * Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, 
 * please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

 * Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no 
 * given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements 
 * up front.

 * spoilers alert... click to show requirements for atoi.

 * Requirements for atoi:
 * The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until 
 * the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this 
 * character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many 
 * numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

 * The string can contain additional characters after those that form the 
 * integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of 
 * this function.

 * If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid 
 * integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty 
 * or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

 * If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the 
 * correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX 
 * (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.
